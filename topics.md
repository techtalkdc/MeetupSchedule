## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: You've Been a Bad Programmer Now Goto Your Room!: Composing Batch Files
* Preferred Timeframe: August or Otherwise
* Event Type: Lightning Talk
* Summary: In most batch files in the wild, there is little or no structure, leading to 
hard-to-read and sometimes scary-to-run scripts. By imposing just a few simple rules, a batch 
file can be transformed into a wonderful jewel of a script that can be simple to read, write 
and maintain. If you need or like to spend time at the command line, you might find this 
useful.

### Innovation and the link to Creativity: To Keep Your Mind Nimble for Work and Life
*Scheduled June 12*

* Session Title: Innovation and the link to Creativity: To keep your mind nimble for work and life
* Preferred Timeframe: End of May, beginning of June. June 13th at the latest.
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture (with a lot of interaction!)
* Summary: Creativity is the act of bringing the world into existence from nothing. Daily challenges in life, personal and at work, constantly beg for inspirational responses and solutions. Creativity allows us to be innovative, to break down these problems, to analyze the situation, and discover many solutions for each piece. Innovators have creative intelligence and use it through five discovery skills. These innovators consciously spend more of their time using and improving these skills. These five skills are: associating, questioning, observing, experimenting, and networking. We can practice and improve these skills by practicing our creativity.
There are two basic ideas of being creative. First, through understanding structure, order, relation, and point of view. Second, that by "flexing your mind" (participation is voluntary and homework is optional) we can remove mental blocks, stretch the imagination muscles, and welcome the unexpected. Life, at home and at work, is destined to get more interesting and fulfilling.

### Painless End to End Testing with Cypress
*Scheduled June 27*

* Session Title: Painless end to end testing with Cypress
* Preferred Timeframe: March - June
* Event Type: 30/50-min Lecture
* Summary:‚Ä®  I recently went to Assert.JS where I saw a demo for Cypress.io. I couldn‚Äôt believe this tool existed and I had never heard about it. I immediately realized all of the things I always wanted in e2e testing had already been done, including things I didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I‚Äôll demo what a cypress workflow looks like and show the cool tricks I‚Äôve learned to make testing easy.

### Introduction to Microservice Architecture
*Scheduled July 25*

* Session Title: Introduction to Microservice Architecture
* Preferred Timeframe: June-July
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Cloud computing, containerization, and automation are becoming the norm for deploying digital solutions. These advancements have led some to rethink the traditional monolith architecture that has defined many areas of software development for so long. Because complicated and resource-intensive deployments are no longer a constraint microservice architectures are becoming popular among developers. Microservices are designed with a focus on scalability and clean code, but they come with a lot of questions. What do we do about shared functionality and cross-cutting concerns? How do we handle communication between microservices? How do we port our existing monolith application over to microservices? In this presentation I will answer these questions and more. I will discuss some common approaches to designing microservices along with the pros and cons of each. I will provide strategies for breaking up your business logic and technical concerns into reasonable services that are maintainable, replaceable, and independently deployable. And I will cover common pitfalls and gotchas that plague microservice designs. This presentation will contain some code samples, but I‚Äôll do my best to keep them straight-forward enough that you won‚Äôt need knowledge of a particular programming language or tech stack to follow along.
