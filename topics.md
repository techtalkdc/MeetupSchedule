## Proposed Topic

* Session Title: Mapping oral histories in the Amazon rainforest using the open-source geostorytelling application Terrastories.io
* Preferred Timeframe: November 30
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Terrastories is a geostorytelling application built to enable local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them. Community members can add places and stories through a user-friendly interface, and make decisions about setting certain stories as private or restricted. Powered by the Mapbox platform, Terrastories is designed to be entirely offline-compatible, so that remote communities can access the application entirely without needing internet connectivity. The design of Terrastories is being stewarded by the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT). With the support of ACT, Terrastories will be used by the Matawai Maroons in Suriname, the Wauja in Brazil, and the Kogui in Colombia to map oral histories about their sacred and ancestral sites, former settlements, and other places of significance.

Rudo Kemper, Mapping and Storytelling Manager at ACT, will discuss the journey of Terrastories from a rough idea dreamed up in the middle of the Amazon rainforest to a robust Ruby on Rails application developed by volunteers from Ruby for Good. He will also talk about his own path from knowing very little coding aside from front end design to learning Rails, Docker, and Ubuntu as a result of unexpected troubleshooting in the jungle, and a desire to understand and contribute to the application.

## Accepted Topics

* Session Title: Using Apache NiFi to Integrate Data into a NoSQL Multi-Model Database
* Preferred Timeframe: October 24th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: Apache NiFi was built to automate the flow of data, providing a drag and drop, configurable user interface. With Apache NiFi, you can use out-of-the-box processors to create data flows from MySQL, Postgres, Apache Kafka, the Hadoop ecosystem, and many other data sources. If a processor doesn’t exist, you can build your own. You can also create templates for common data flow patterns, then publish and share them for collaboration needs.

Scott Fowler, MarkLogic Principal Sales Engineer, will discuss the value of integrating unstructured and structured data from multiple sources into an Operational Data Hub. This presentation will include a demonstration using Apache NiFi to ingest data into a MarkLogic NoSQL database.
