* Session Title: You've Been a Bad Programmer Now Goto Your Room!: Composing Batch Files
* Preferred Timeframe: August or Otherwise

* Summary: In many batch files in the wild, there is little or no structure, leading to hard-to-read and sometimes scary-to-run scripts. By imposing just a few simple rules, a batch file can be transformed into a wonderful jewel of a script that can be simple to read, write and maintain.

### Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul
*Scheduled August 29th* 

* Session Title: Chicken Soup for the Automated Soul: How small teams can iterate on launching code for big projects
* Preferred Timeframe: Sometime before September 15th
* Event Type: 50-min Lecture
* Summary: At NPR Digital Media we have chosen Jenkins CI as our in-house choice for launching code. While smaller projects lend themselves well to the Jenkins paradigm, large monolith repos do not. This talk is about how a small team of 30+ developers handle the stresses of launching something that millions depend on and our brand rests its laurels on. Focus will be on things we've tried, things we've failed at, and things we're still iterating.
